Roll the dice and note the symbols in your grid to score as many points as possible!

To win, you will have to keep an eye on all the rows and columns and try to create sequences of 2, 3, 4, or even 5 identical symbols!

Detrak is a PWA — a Progressive Web App — hosted at [detrak.net](https://detrak.net).

You can play online directly, and if you want, install it on your device — search for "Install" or "Add to home screen" in your browser's menu.

> [!NOTE]
> Detrak used to be present on the Google Play store, but I had to remove it because Google starting requiring independent developers to publicly disclose personal information, including our home address.
